title: "Galaxy Nexus slowness"
---
<p>
My Galaxy Nexus was getting really slow over the last few weeks, meaning simple
things like going to the homescreen took multiple seconds.
</p>

<p>
Turns out that the problem is the SD card filesystem / controller getting
really slow once the SD card gets nearly filled up. You can verify this by
running <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromeda.androbench2">Androbench,
a storage benchmark app</a>. You should get a sequential write performance of a
few MB/s (e.g. 8 MB/s), but when affected by the problem, you get about 0.x
MB/s.
</p>

<p>
The fix is to delete files to make sure you have plenty of spare capacity, then
run <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grilledmonkey.lagfix">fstrim,
neatly packaged in this app</a>, followed by a reboot.
</p>

<p>
In case you havenâ€™t rooted your phone for a while, the currently working way is
using SuperSU, not Superuser.
